## Knowledge Set for Machine Learning Algorithms

### Regression V.S. Clustering

* Regression:
    - Don't need softmax in the last layer in Neural Networks
    - Output is usually continuous value, thus has a statistics to measure how the output is closer to the actual result.
* Clustering:
    - Need softmax in the last layer in Neural Networks
    - Output is usually discrete, thus the accuracy of the output is just 1 or 0.

### Reinforcement Learning

* Intro:
    - Encourage the bot to learn prone to the track with greatest reward.
